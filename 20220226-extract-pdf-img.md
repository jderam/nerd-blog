# Extracting Image Files from a PDF

Here  I present two methods for extracting image files from a PDF. Let's get started.

## Option 1: `poppler-utils`

Install the poppler-utils package.

On ubuntu/debian systems:
```
sudo apt install poppler-utils
```

On MacOS:
```
brew install poppler
```

Now you will have the handy command `pdfimages` available on your system.
